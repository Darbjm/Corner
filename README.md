<h1>Freelance Project: Corner !!Currently Under contruction!!</h1>

<h2>Problem: People want more say in what their local stores supply, local stores want better research on this.</h2>

<h2>Solution: Build a web app that allows users to vote on food goods for their local area, and allow local stores to access this data.</h2>

<h2 name='overview'>Overview</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

Myself and a friend recognised that there was a need to improve the way people voiced their desires
for food goods. We believe this could help local stores increase their sales while catering to areas
that wanted different foods such as carbon balanced foods.

<!-- <h3>Deployment</h3>

The app is deployed on Heroku and can be found here: https://wordee-app.herokuapp.com <br> The login
details are email: test@email password: pass <br> -->

<h2 name='brief'>Brief</h2>

- **Build a voting system** Create a web app that allows users to vote on certain foods and local
  stores to see this
- **Have a map** The map should display the votes for foods in in area codes
- **Local stores should be able to create profiles** and show if they have desired good.
- **Have a simple design**
- **Be deployed online**

<h2 name='tech'>Technologies used and why?</h2>

I am still currently building this however I am using:

<strong>TypeScript<strong> because it stops simple bugs creeping in, speeding up development
<strong>Storybook<strong> because it's easy to check, test and share UI components with my colleague
<strong>Redux<strong> because it allows me to make one request for the user meaning it is faster
<strong>Atomic Design<strong> because it makes my project easier to manage, keep brand consistency,
and bring on other engineers later on <strong>Django<strong> because it is quick and easy to setup
with pre built features I can use

<!-- <h2 name='app'>App</h2>

The brand will log into the app will immediately be able to edit their supporting data that will be
sent to copy writers along with their briefs.The brand will be sent a report summary it can access
as soon as we have sent it.<br> <br> <br> <img src='readme/1.gif' width='600'> <br> <br> <br>
Creating a brief is made simple by asking the brand to fill out a set of questions my colleagues
thought essentially to fully explain what is needed. The brief reacts to choices made adds or
removes questions accordingly.<br> <br> <br> <img src='readme/2.gif' width='600'> <br> <br> <br> The
brand can easily edit the brief just by clicking on its list item.<br> <br> <br>
<img src='readme/3.gif' width='600'> <br> <br> <br> The brand can easily change or remove their
information.<br> <br> <br> <img src='readme/4.gif' width='600'> <br> <br> <br> On the backend my
colleagues and I are able to view brands and their information and can easily edit report summarys,
download briefs to excel, and view images and files.<br> <br> <br>

<h2 name='approach'>Approach</h2>
My approach was to always keep the user in mind when I made every decisions, for instance my first instinct was to make a profile page and an edit profile page. However I believe this gave the experiance needless friction for the user. Therefore these pages could be combined for easy and fast manipulation. This eneded making my code more simple too.

<h3>A writers portal</h3>
We were discussing creating a writers portal and profile and I have some code commented out in the login component should we build this. However we don't currently see any use for this<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Email alert system</h3>
We would like to be alerted by email if a user updates their information or edits a brief so we could send the new data to any writers who need it.<br>

<h3>Tested by TRIP DRINKS</h3>
[TRIP DRINKS](https://www.drink-trip.com/) Tested our app and found it very useful saying it was functional and well designed. TRIP is still using it and we are arranging user testing.

<h3>GaphQL</h3>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Redux</h3>

<br>
<br>
<h3>Design</h3>
I'm personally very happy with the design, I think it looks good and is easy to use. Getting feedback from users like TRIP saying "it's functional and well designed"

<h3>COVID-19</h3>
Due to the pandemic we are having to pause development due to this being a side project for my colleagues.
<br>
<br>
<h3>CircleCI</h3>
I seem to behaving trouble getting the backend up and therefore test it in CircleCI. I have emailed them asking for support.

<h3>Brand images</h3>
Sometimes when uploading brand images the images may not appear on the brand profile until the page is reloaded. I checked to see if the getData function was waiting until the upload to the backend had been completed and it was.<br>

• Use TypeScript to better avoid bugs like merging objects and arrays.<br>
• Use Storybook to test UI components.<br> -->
